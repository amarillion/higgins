	<a name="intro"><h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
		In the famous musical "my fair lady" Professor Higgins
		was the professor who tried to teach proper english
		to Eliza Doolittle. Like in the movie, Dr. Higgins
		will teach you and help you teach yourself any language
		you like.
	</p>
	<p>
		The program is extremely useful for improving your vocabulary
		of a foreing language. It works like a quiz, the program asks you
		what the translation of a certain word is and you have to type it in.
		The program will tell you if you are right or wrong and will keep score 
		for you. 
	</p>
	<p>		
		There is more. As any good teacher knows, <em>the key to learning
		is repetition</em>. When you don't remember the answer, Dr. Higgins will
		keep repeating the question every few turns until you get it right two
		times in a row. Moreover, by default each question is asked at least
		four times before the quiz ends. This may sound boring, but trust me,
		it works very well. Usually four repetitions is enough to learn
		any unfamiliar piece of vocabulary completely by heart in a matter
		of a few hours.
	</p>
	<p>
		This program is meant as help with self-study. It might also prove
		useful for high-school students and the like who have a vocabulary
		test coming up.
	</p>
	<a name="running"><h2>Running a quiz</h2>
	<p>
		
	</p>
	<a name="ending"><h2>When the quiz ends</h2>
	<p>
	</p>
	<a name="log"><h2>The log</h2>
	<p>
		Dr. Higgins keeps a log of which lessons you study and how long
		it takes. This way you can keep track of what you've done, and
		you may set targets for yourself, e.g. to study two hours per week.
		In the log you can see if you manage to keep your resolutions.
	</p>
	<a name="options"><h2>The options menu</h2>
	<p>
		In the menu File->Options you can override the number of bins
		for the current quiz. For example, if you already studied the
		current quiz before and you're merely refreshing your memory,
		repeating every word four times may be overkill. In those cases
		you can reduce the number of bins to 3 or 2.
		(At this time ths is the only option available in the options menu, 
		this may change in the future)
	</p>
	<a name="adding"><h2>Adding your own word list</h2>
	<p>
		Would you like to study a certain language but Dr. Higgins doesn't 
		have suitable word lists? No problem! You can easily make your own.
	</p><p>
		Do you have to study all the words on page 23 of your text book
		for a test? Simply add them to Dr. Higgins and you'll have them
		memorized before dinner.
	</p><p>
		So how do you add word lists? It's very simple. Open up notepad or
		a similar text editing program, and type in the word - translation pairs
		separated by a comma, only one pair per line. When you're done, simply
		save them in the "lessons" subdirectory of Dr. Higgins, and you can
		open the new lesson from withing Dr. Higgins. You have to use
		the filename extension "txt" (which is the default extension in notepad).
	</p>
	<img src="images/image1.png" alt="notepad example">
	<p>
		Note that if you use e.g. Microsoft Word or a similar word processor, 
		you need to make sure that you save as text only (*.txt) format.
	</p>
	<p>
		Dr. Higgins is fairly forgiving in mistakes you may make, but do pay attention 
		to this: Never use more than one comma in a line. The program looks for a comma to
		find out where the word ends and the translation begins. If you use
		more than one comma, or if you use no comma at all, the program may get
		confused.
	</p>
	<p>
		When you load a lesson that you've made yourself, Dr. Higgins will scan the file and
		look for certain kinds of inconsistencies. It will ignore those lines
		containing inconsistencies and run the quiz anyway, but you may want to
		note them down and look back at them in order to fix the problem.
	</p>
	<p>
		One of the inconsistencies that will give you a warning is forgetting a comma
		in a line. Another one is using the same word more than once. For example:
	</p>
	<p><pre>
		ser, to be
		tener, to have
		comer, to eat
		estar, to be
	</pre></p>
	<p>
		In this list there are two entries for "to be". This would be very annoying
		because if the program asks you "to be" there is no way to know if the right answer
		is "ser" or "estar". You may answer ser and be right only 50% of the times.
	</p>
	<p>
		Whenever this situation occurs, I recommend you put both options on the same line, like so:
	</p>
	<p><pre>
		ser / estar, to be
		tener, to have
		comer, to eat
	</pre></p>
	<p>
		This way has the disadvantage that now you always have to give both answers together
		when the program asks you the translation for "to be". However, synonyms do occur a
		lot and this is just a fact of life, so you might as well find a way to deal with it.
	</p>
	<p>
		It's no problem to have a few empty lines in the file. Also, you can add comments 
		by using the "#" character. If a line starts with #, it will be ignored by the 
		program, for example:
	</p>
	<p><pre>
		<span class="comment"># Spanish words from the textbook page 23.</span>
		<span class="comment"># by Peter</span>
		
		<span class="comment"># here are some verbs</span>
		ser / estar, to be
		tener, to have
		comer, to eat
		
		<span class="comment"># some nouns</span>
		el restaurante, the restaurant
		el coche, the car
	</pre></p>
	<p>
		There are a few more tricks you can do with lesson files. You may
		add some extra properties like so:
	</p>
	<p><pre>
		<span class="comment">#question1=What is "" in Dutch?</span>
		<span class="comment">#question2=What is "" in English?</span>
		<span class="comment">#askbothways=1</span>
		<span class="comment">#bins=3</span>		
		kind, child
		vader, father
		vriendelijk, kind
		gierig, greedy
	</pre></p>
	<p>
		Dr. Higgins normally asks you something like "What is xxx", where
		xxx is one of the words in the lesson. By using the properties "question1" 
		and "question2", you may override this question by something you make up, in
		this case the question would be eiter "What is xxx in Dutch" or 
		"What is xxx in English". This can be useful, especially in this case, otherwise
		there would be no way to see if Dr. Higgins is asking for the Dutch translation
		of the English word kind (vriendelijk) or 
		the English translation of the Dutch word kind (child).
	</p>
	<p>
		The property askbothways may be set to 0 to force the program
		to use the part before the comma as question only (never as answer) and
		the part after the comma as answer only. This may be useful in cases where you
		want to e.g. test yourself with conjugations or plurals. Alternatively, you
		could use this feature to enter e.g. country, capital pairs and 
		quiz yourself for the capitals.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally, you may use the property bins to set the default number of bins for this quiz.
		If you leave it out, the default is 4. This may be useful for really long and easy quizes,
		where you can do with less repetition.
	</p>
	<p>
		Of course, all these properties are optional. All you really need is a list of word pairs
		and you're ready to go! It's easy as that.
